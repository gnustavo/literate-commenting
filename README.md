# Literate Commenting #

    Literate programming is a programming methodology that combines a programming
    language with a documentation language, making programs more robust, more
    portable, and more easily maintained than programs written only in a high-level
    language.

    -- Donald E. Knuth

Literate Programming is a great idea.  If you're a programmer and enjoys the
art, read [the
book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112245.Literate_Programming) or go
straight to the [source](http://www-cs-staff.stanford.edu/~knuth/).

In 1995, when I was reading the book, I was eager to apply the methodololy.
Around the same time I was listening to [Jethro
Tull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jethro_Tull_%28band%29)'s Aqualung album.
On its cover there was a very interesting poem, although hard to grasp.  Some of
the words in it grabbed my attention, not due to their meaning in the text, but
because they were part of the programming jargon.  Hence, I got the idea of
trying to read the text as if there were comments in a C++ program.  The program
didn't need to make much sense, but it should compile and "match", in the best
way possible, the comments.

It ended up being easier than I expected.  After the first version, I fixed a
few bugs and, modesty apart, I became proud of the result (`aqualung.cc`).  I
even thought about sending it to Knuth himself, suggesting that he could use it
as an example in an upcoming book, but I gave up.  At best he would have told me
that the exercise was more like Literate Commenting than Literate
Programming. :)
